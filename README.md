#Implementation
There are three classes implementing different types of load balancers according to the specifications.  

Steps 1,2 and 3 are implemented in LoadBalancerRandom.
Steps 1,2, 3 and 4 are implemented in LoadBalancerRoundRobin.  
Steps 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 are implemented in LoadBalancerRoundRobinEnhanced.  

So the final implementation would be LoadBalancerRoundRobinEnhanced.
